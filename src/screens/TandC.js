                    only. Actual values will vary based on numerous factors

                    surrounding trees, buildings and other structures, weather,
                    etc.

                    <br />
                    4.    Work will not be undertaken unless your switchboard

                    (within the design rules), and adjust the final price
                    accordingly.
                    <br />
                    6.    Location for solar panels must be clear of any
